# NgRx Ducks

This library acts as a thin layer on top of ngrx.
It automatically creates action creators and reducer functions for you.
Furthermore, you get a service that you can use in your components.
This Service provides a strictly typed API allowing both dispatching actions and
selecting data from the Store.
