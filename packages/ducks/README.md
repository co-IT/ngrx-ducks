# NgRx Ducks

This library acts as a thin layer on top of ngrx.
It automatically creates action creators and reducer functions for you.
Furthermore, you get a service that you can use in your components.
This Service provides a strictly typed API allowing both dispatching actions and
selecting data from the Store.

## Quick Start

[Getting started in 10 Minutes](https://github.com/co-IT/ngrx-ducks/blob/master/packages/ducks/docs/quick-start.md).

## Demo

Please checkout the demo hosted on <a href="https://stackblitz.com/edit/ngrx-ducks?embed=1&file=src/app/store/counter/counter.duck.ts" target="_blank">StackBlitz</a>.
It shows how ngrx and ngrx-ducks work together.
